# Debugging

I spent this day mostly by going through Python debugging, which is kinda straightforward in 
PyCharm as I am used to JetBrains products, but as I do all of my hundredpies challenge coding 
in Neovim, it is not that easy peasy. There are some ways and I might incorporate them later, 
but for now, I go well with just print statements. At the end, I am not crafting third world problems 
solutions here...yet.

See you on a day 14.
