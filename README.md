# hundredpies

I am not much of a challenges guy, but this time, I am going to go with a 
well know [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com) challenge, in my case for Python.

I'm learning Python as a part of my getting to know DevOps stuff journey. First step was to 
turn an old macbook into an Ubuntu Server for further learning experiments. Now I am all about 
Ansible and Python.

Not going to tweet about my daily coding as the challenge requires, but I do share my DevOps 
learning journey on a [freshly baked blog of mine](https://charamza.substack.com). This journey 
or a path, let's say, already included completely redoing the way I take notes and the way I learn.

So what I will use to code my way through this challenge? Well, Vim, or NeoVim, of course. Because I want 
to learn those as well :P


## Day 7 - the first time of creating something

On Day 7, I focused on learning how to fetch data and create a simple CLI game: the classic Hangman. 
The game prompts you to enter the length of a word you'd like to guess, fetches the word from 
[Random Word API](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home), and then you can start guessing. 

I've included the binary [/day007/hangman](day007/hangman), so you can download and run it on macOS or Linux without needing 
Python installed. Feel free to give it a try!
